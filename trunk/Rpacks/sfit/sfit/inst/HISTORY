Package: sfit
=============

Version: 0.1.2 [2006-07-21]
o Updated the help pages.


Version: 0.1.1 [2006-05-20]
o First version of the package where the cfit binary is automatically 
  build upon R CMD INSTALL.  It is still no shared library that is
  build, i.e. the approach to dump data to file, call 'cfit', and then
  let R parse the cfit result is still used.  But at least it should
  not (in theory) install and run on all platforms.


Version: 0.1.0 [2006-05-07]
o Created.  Had a similar version in 2003.
