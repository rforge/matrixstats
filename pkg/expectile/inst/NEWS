Package: expectile
==================

Version: 0.3.0 [2012-06-22]
o Now using .onAttach() instead of .First.lib().
o Now sfit2() passes NA instead of NULL to .C("Rwrapper_sfit0").
o BUG FIX: The previous workaround for using prior +Inf weights and
  pass them to the native code as .Machine$double.xmax did no longer
  work; it resulted in missing values in the results.  Passing
  Inf as sqrt(.Machine$double.xmax) seems to work.
o Package passes R CMD check on R v2.15.0 and R devel.


Version: 0.2.6 [2012-03-23]
o Now package uses packageStartupMessage() instead of cat() when loaded.


Version: 0.2.5 [2009-06-12]
o Made loexp() internal for now.


Version: 0.2.4 [2008-12-26]
o BUG FIX: Single-pass skewness calculation was incorrect. This
  could be the cause for poor convergence with some data sets.


Version: 0.2.3 [2008-09-08]
o Updated the internal native sfit algorithm to fit the
  simplex/cone with a weighted prior simplex/cone.


Version: 0.2.2 [2008-08-31]
o fitCone() calls fitExpectileCone() as is.
o Added fitExpectileCone(), which returns an ExpectileCone object.
o Added points(), lines() and radials() to ExpectileCone.


Version: 0.2.1 [2008-08-03]
o Added loexp(), which previously was in the 'loexp' package.
o Updated the help page for sfit2 and a fixed a bug in its examples.
o Package passes R CMD check on R v2.7.1 and R v2.8.0 devel.


Version: 0.2.0 [2008-04-12]
o Created.
