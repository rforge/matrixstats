\title{Package matrixStats}


\description{
  This packages provides methods operating on rows and columns of matrices, e.g. col/rowMedians() and col/rowRanks().  There are also some vector-based methods, e.g. anyMissing(), weightedMedians(), and binMeans().  The objective is to have all methods being optimized for speed and memory usage.
}

\section{Installation}{
  To install this package, please do:
  \preformatted{
    install.packages("matrixStats")
  }
}

\section{How to contribute}{
  This is an open-source project which embraces collaborations.
  If you have improvements on code and/or documentation, or
  new function, please consider contributing them to this package.
}

\section{For developers}{
  It is currently not decided whether the methods should be S4 or S3
  methods.
  This is the reason why some methods are based on S4 and some on S3.
  The ones using S3 rely on the \pkg{R.methodsS3} package to define the
  methods.
  There are also dependancies on other packages.  The plan
  is to remove all such dependancies as soon as the API settles, but
  until then, we keep the dependencies for conveniency and in order to
  avoid reduncancy of available implementations of identical methods.
