\title{Accurately computes the logarithm of the sum of exponentials across rows or columns}

\description{
  Accurately computes the logarithm of the sum of exponentials across rows or columns.
}

\usage{
 rowLogSumExps(lx, na.rm=FALSE, ...)
 colLogSumExps(lx, na.rm=FALSE, ...)
}

\arguments{
 \item{lx}{A \code{\link[base]{numeric}} NxK \code{\link[base]{matrix}}.
  Typically \code{lx} are \eqn{log(x)} values.}
 \item{na.rm}{If \code{\link[base:logical]{TRUE}}, any missing values are ignored, otherwise not.}
 \item{...}{Not used.}
}

\value{
 A \code{\link[base]{numeric}} \code{\link[base]{vector}} of length N (K).
}

\section{Benchmarking}{
  These methods are implemented in native code and have been optimized
  for speed and memory.
