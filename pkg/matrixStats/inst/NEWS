Package: matrixStats
====================

Version: 0.1.7 [2009-06-20]
WORKAROUND: Cannot use "%#x" in rowTabulates() when creating the column
names of the result matrix.  It gav an error OSX with R v2.9.0 devel
(2009-01-13 r47593b) current the OSX server at R-forge.


Version: 0.1.6 [2009-06-17]
o Updated the Rdoc example for rowWeightedMedians() to run conditionally 
  on aroma.light, which is only a suggested package - not a required one.
  This in order to prevent R CMD check to fail on CRAN, which prevents
  it for building binaries (as it currently happens on their OSX servers).


Version: 0.1.5 [2009-02-04]
o BUG FIX: For some errors in rowOrderStats(), the stack would not 
  become UNPROTECTED before calling error.
 

Version: 0.1.4 [2009-02-02]
o Added methods {col|row}Weighted{Mean|Median}s() for weighted averaging.
o Added more Rdoc comments.
o Package passes R CMD check flawlessly.


Version: 0.1.3 [2008-07-30]
o Added {col|row}Tabulates() for integer and raw matrices.
o BUG FIX: rowCollapse(x) was broken and returned the wrong elements.


Version: 0.1.2 [2008-04-13]
o Added {col|row}Collapse().
o Added varDiff(), sdDiff() and madDiff().
o Added indexByRow().


Version: 0.1.1 [2008-03-25]
o Added {col|row}OrderStats().
o Added {col|row}Ranges() and {col|row}{Min|Max}s().
o Added colMedians().
o Now anyMissing() support most data types as structures.
