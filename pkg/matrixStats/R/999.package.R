#
# \section{For developers}{
#   It is currently not decided whether the methods should be S4 or S3
#   methods.
#   This is the reason why some methods are based on S4 and some on S3.
#   The ones using S3 rely on the \pkg{R.methodsS3} package to define the
#   methods.
#   There are also dependancies on other packages.  The plan
#   is to remove all such dependancies as soon as the API settles, but
#   until then, we keep the dependencies for conveniency and in order to
#   avoid reduncancy of available implementations of identical methods.
